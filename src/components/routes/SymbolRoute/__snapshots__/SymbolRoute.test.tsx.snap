    <p>
      It appears you have discovered a Viii symbol out in the world – but what does it mean?
    </p>
    <div
      class="SymbolRoute--symbol"
    />
    <p>
      Aside from being an embodiment of the artist known as Viii (pronounced 'Vee'), it also represents the different sides of identity...
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the points of the triangle represent the start of a field of vision – three different perspectives of an individual:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        How they see themselves
      </li>
      <li>
        How others see them
      </li>
      <li>
        How they wish to be seen by others
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The open eye in the centre of the triangle represents the individual themselves, with them being fully self-aware and mindful of these perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name 'Viii' also correlates to the meanings behind the symbol, with 'V' symbolising the viewpoint/triangle, with three of the letter 'i' representing each 'identity' perspective.
